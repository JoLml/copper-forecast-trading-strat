# ðŸŸ  Copper Price Forecasting & Trading Strategy with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project implements a **machine learning-based predictive trading strategy** targeting short-term price movements of copper, a crucial industrial metal. By leveraging technical indicators and a Random Forest classifier, it forecasts market direction and backtests a rule-based trading strategy to evaluate profitability.

It showcases practical skills in **financial data science**, **feature engineering**, **machine learning classification**, and **quantitative trading**.

## Motivation & Objectives

Copper prices are highly sensitive to global economic cycles, making accurate forecasting valuable for traders and analysts. This project aims to:

- Collect and preprocess historical copper price data  
- Engineer relevant technical indicators to capture market signals  
- Train a Random Forest classifier to predict price direction (up/down)  
- Backtest a trading strategy driven by model signals to assess profitability  
- Provide a user-friendly dashboard for real-time monitoring  

---

## Data & Feature Engineering

- Historical copper price data sourced from Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`  
- Key technical indicators computed include:  
  - Moving Averages (MA20, MA50)  
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)  
  - Bollinger Bands  
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)  
  - Momentum & Rate of Change (ROC)  
  - 20-day Volatility  

These features capture trend, momentum, and volatility aspects of the market.

## Modeling Approach

- Random Forest Classifier trained on labeled data representing price movement direction  
- Model evaluated using classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)  
- Feature importance analyzed to identify most predictive indicators  

---

## Strategy Backtesting

- Trading signals derived from model predictions trigger simulated buy/sell actions  
- Performance benchmarked against buy-and-hold strategy  
- Returns and risk metrics computed and visualized  

---

## Interactive Dashboard

Built with Streamlit, the dashboard provides:  

- Latest price prediction with confidence score  
- Historical backtest performance charts  
- Raw data and indicator visualization
